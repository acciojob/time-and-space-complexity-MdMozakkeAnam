	<h1>Time and Space Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time Complexity is amount of taken by an algorithm to run a program , A programer is always try to optimize a Time Complexity of code and making it more efficient.</p>
	<p><b>Space Coplixity</b> is amount of take memory teken by an algoritm to complete a program , Example - A Linear Seach algorith taking O(n) Space Complexity to comlete it's Task.</p>
