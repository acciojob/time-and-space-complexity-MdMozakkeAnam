   <h1>Time and Space Complexity</h1>
   <p>Time Complexity is the amount of time taken by an algorithm to run a program. Programmers always try to optimize a code's Time Complexity to make it more efficient.</p>
   <p><b>Space Complexity</b> is the amount of memory taken by an algorithm to complete a program. Example: A Linear Search algorithm takes O(n) Space Complexity to complete its task.</p
